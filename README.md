Here are some small projects I've made. 

Hangman Project: 
This pulls from a list of hundreds of random words and then lets you play against it. I also implemented a life counter and a way for you to see what letters you've used so far. This was one of the first programming projects I've made. 

Sudoku Solver: 
Using a little bit of math and a little more of computing algorithms, I created a program that can solve any given 3 x 3 sudoku input. It uses a backtracking algorithm that tests if possible entries are possible, and then reverts back if it isn't. I ended up using a bit of modular arithmetic to figure out how to keep distinct digits in each box of 9, and the rest came together with some programs.
